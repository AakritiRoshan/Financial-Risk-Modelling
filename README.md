# Financial-Risk-Modelling
Financial risk modeling is at the intersection of two domains: Fintech and Big Data. In this project I have covered three financial risk modeling techniques: covariance matrices, factor models, and value-at-risk by implementing a robust risk modeling approach using Python. I start with discovering risk, uncertainty, and standard deviation. Next up, i have explored the role of covariance matrices in modeling risk. Lastly, I have built scenario-based stress tests using factor models.
